## Git-Work

The intention of this project is to provide basic details about Git Usage and Git workflow model implementation. 


### Git installation - Windows                          

1. Download Git. 
    
    There are few ways to install git on windows
    
    * Offical Git Website: [Download Link] (http://git-scm.com/download/win) - The download will start automatically.

    * Git for Windows - Separate from Offical Git: Download the latest [Git for Windows installer](https://git-for-windows.github.io/).
        
        
2. When you've successfully started the installer, you should see the Git Setup wizard screen. Follow the *Next* and *Finish* prompts to complete the installation. The default options are pretty sensible for most users.

    Recommendation: Elect to use Git Bash during installation.

3. Verify the Git version using below command.

    ```sh
    $ git --version
    ```
